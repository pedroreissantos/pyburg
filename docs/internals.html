<H2><a name="intro"></a>1. Introduction</H2>

This document aims at providing some insight on all the routines developped for the <b>pyburg</b> module.
The <a href="#high">high-level functions</a> are called externally by the user.
The other routines are document to make undestanding of the code smooth and facilitate further changes.

<H2><a name="high"></a>2. High-level functions</H2>

The <a href="#run">run</a> routine is the top level user routine.
The <a href="#select">select</a> routine is the actual BURG algorithm, and the
<a href="burg">burg</a>,
<a href="parse">parse</a> and
<a href="table">table</a> routines are used to build a grammar from different input formats.

<H3><a name="debug"></a>2.1 Debug</H3>

The <tt>pyburg</tt> package already includes an extensive debug mode to help
developers.
A <tt>debug</tt> variable can be set to values ranging from <tt>0</tt>
produce no debug information, to <tt>5</tt>, the highest debug level.
<pre>
pyburg.debug=0 # no debug
</pre>
A <tt>debug</tt> value higher than <tt>0</tt> will report errors while
processing the grammer, no match for start symbol in input processing,
and print the tree final cost.
A <tt>debug</tt> value higher than <tt>1</tt> will also print the reduced
rules and reports a missing <tt>goal</tt> variable or if it unable to produce 
grammar from the input arguments.
A <tt>debug</tt> value higher than <tt>2</tt> include labeling information
about tree node and rules.
A <tt>debug</tt> value higher than <tt>3</tt> reports costs.
A <tt>debug</tt> value higher than <tt>4</tt> prints reduce state information and closure setup.

<H3><a name="run"></a>2.2 Run</H3>
The <tt>run</tt> function is the high level <b>pyburg</b> function, it
builds all internal data and performs the labeling and reduction of the
given tree.
<pre>
def run(tree, module=None, terms=None, start=None, user=None, output=None):
</pre>
The <tt>tree</tt> argument is the root node of the AST. Each node includes
a <tt>.label()</tt> method that returns the node label and <tt>.left()</tt>
and <tt>.right()</tt> methods to return the node branches. The branches should be <tt>None</tt> for leaf nodes and unary nodes provide only a left branch.
The node must be object in order to <b>pyburg</b> to add state information
to each node.
<p>
The <tt>module</tt> argument is a loaded module or <tt>None</tt> if the module
containing the grammar is the same module in which the <tt>.run()</tt> caller
resides. The module will be scanned for relavant variables and <tt>b_</tt>
prefixed functions.
<p>
The <tt>terms</tt> argument is a list of terminals symbols, if <tt>None</tt>
is provided the module variable <tt>terminals</tt> will used.
If no such variable exists it will determined from the grammar but no
consistency checking can be performed.
<p>
The <tt>start</tt> argument is the grammar start symbol, if <tt>None</tt> is
provided the module variable <tt>goal</tt> will be used.
<p>
The <tt>user</tt> and <tt>output</tt> arguments are any user variable to be
passed to reduce routines. Their main purpose in code generation is the output
file (<tt>output</tt>) and the processor instruction set (<tt>user</tt>).
<p>
The routine builds the grammar, either from a dictionary (<tt>parse</tt>) or
from a module (<tt>burg</tt>), loads the required variables (<tt>terminals</tt>, <tt>goal</tt>) and calls the <tt>select</tt> routine.

<H3><a name="select"></a>2.4 Select</H3>

The <tt>select</tt> routine performs the labeling and reduction of a <tt>tree</tt> given a pattern grammar (<tt>gram</tt>).
The terminals (<tt>terms</tt>) are used to check the grammar.
The <tt>start</tt> symbol, ot target symbol of the grammar, can extracted from the grammar's left hand side symbol of the first rule.
The <tt>fdir</tt> is a function dictionary that maps names to functions pointers, used in variable cost rules.
The <tt>user</tt> and <tt>output</tt> are parameters to be passed to each of the user supplied reduction routines.

<H3><a name="burg"></a>2.4 Burg</H3>

The <tt>burg</tt> routine builds a grammar list of rules from a function dictionary that maps function names to functions pointers.
From each <tt>b_</tt> prefixed routine in the dictionary, a rule grammar is built.
The routine provides the docstring containing the rules description.
The description is parsed by the <tt>rule</tt> routine to extract four items:
<ol>
<li>the left hand side non-terminal (string)
</li><li>the right hand side pattern (pyburg.Tree)
</li><li>the rule cost (integer)
</li><li>the action function (function pointer)
</li>
</ol>

<H3><a name="parse"></a>2.5 parse</H3>

The <tt>parse</tt> routine, as the previous <tt>burg</tt> routine, also builds a grammar list of rules from a dictionary.
This dictionary, however, is not extracted from a python module, instead it is built by the user and must contain all the required information.
In this approach no docstrings are used to describe the rules.
The dictionary also maps strings to function pointers, but the strings are the rules themselves.
These rules can be identified by the ':' character in the string, that is not a valid character in a variable or function name.
Besides the rules, the dictionary must also provide all required information, such as the <tt>goal</tt> and the <tt>terminals</tt> variables or any variable cost functions, all refered by name.
Am example of such a grammar is depict by the <tt>gram</tt> variable in <a href=../exs/sample4.py">this example</a>.

<H3><a name="table"></a>2.6 Table</H3>

Routine that converts the module based representation used by the <tt>burg</tt> routine into the table based approach used by the <tt>parse</tt> routine.

<H2><a name="rule"></a>3. Parsing of a grammar rule</H2>

The <tt>rule</tt> routine parses a <tt>b_</tt> prefixed routine, extracting its docstring and returning a 4 element tuple that represents the rule (see the <tt>burg</tt> routine for the tuple description).
The <tt>t_</tt> and <tt>p_</tt> prefixed functions are used to parse the string using <b>ply</b>.
The variables <tt>func</tt>, <tt>rule_parser</tt> and <tt>rule_lexer</tt> are used for error reporting and to build the parser only once. Building the parsers for each parsed rule would be unnecessarily expensive.

<H2><a name="reflect"></a>4. Reflection parsing functions</H2>

The reflection parsing routines were extract from <b>ply</b>:
<ol>
<li><tt>get_caller_module_dict</tt> returns a dictionary of all symbols in the current module at the given depth <tt>level</tt>. The depth depends on nesting level of the calling routine.
</li><li><tt>entries</tt> returns a dictionary of all symbols in the given module. If no module is given, the above <tt>get:caller_module_dict</tt> is returned.
</ol>

<H2><a name="check"></a>5. Grammar consistency checking functions</H2>

These functions are used to collect information from the given grammar and perform consistency checks in order to ensure a valid and usable grammar.

<H3><a name="nonterms"></a>5.1 Non-terminals</H3>

<tt>nonterms</tt> returns a dictionary containing a maps from all grammar non-terminal to the number of rules that produce it: rules where the non-terminal is the left hand side of the context free grammar.

<H3><a name="cktree"></a>5.2 Check tree</H3>

<tt>cktree</tt> checks the arity consistency of all terminals in a <tt>rule</tt>.
A dictionary <tt>term</tt>, with each terminal initially set to <b>-1</b>, contains the number of arguments used with each terminal.
If the terminal is used with different arities, an error is reported.
Any missing terminals in the dictionary are also reported.
Return the number of errors found.

<H3><a name="ckrules"></a>5.3 Check rules</H3>

<tt>ckrules</tt> checks the reachability of all rules, using a dictionary <tt>visit</tt> to map
non-terminal symbols to <b>1</b> (visited node).
Also calls <tt>cktree</tt> to check the arity of terminals within each rule.
Return the number of errors found.

<H3><a name="ckreach"></a>5.4 Check reach</H3>

<tt>ckreach</tt> performs a global check of reachability and arity over the grammar, calling the above routines.
Report the unreachable non-terminals.
Return the number of errors found.

<H3><a name="closure"></a>5.5 Check closure</H3>

A closure is a rule that consumes no terminals, for instance: <tt>instr : expr</tt>.
This <tt>closure</tt> routine builds the <tt>closures</tt> argument, if <tt>None</tt> is given.
Since this is an expensive step, the <tt>closures</tt> variable is kept for subsequent calls to this routine.
If the given <tt>node</tt> has closures, the cost (fixed or variable) is determined and associated with the <tt>node.state</tt> of the rule left hand non-terminal symbol.

<H3><a name="terminals"></a>5.6 terminals and findterms</H3>

The <tt>terminals</tt> routine is invoqued when the <tt>terminals</tt> variable
is not defined in the grammar.
It extracts all right hand symbols that do not appear in the left hand side, since the grammar is context free.
This approach, however, invalidates the checking of the declared terminal symbols.
<p>
The <tt>findterms</tt> routine acts on the right hand side of a pattern node and, recusively, collects all symbols that are present in the <tt>nts</tt> argument (a list of all right hand side symbols in the grammar, i.e. the grammar non-terminals).
<p>
The <tt>terminals</tt> routine iterates over all grammar rules and collects the terminal symbols of each rule, given by the <tt>findterms</tt> routine, into a set to avoid duplicates.

<H2><a name="labeling"></a>6. Labeling functions</H2>

Labeling routines perform the calculation of the minimal costs for each non-terminal symbol in the grammar for every node in the tree.
A subsequent reduction process will select the lowest cost.
The labeling process performs a depth first tree scanning.

<H3><a name="sumcosts"></a>6.1 Sum costs</H3>
Return the sum of costs of every branch of the given <tt>node</tt>.

<H3><a name="match"></a>6.2 Match</H3>

The <tt>match</tt> routine returns <tt>True</tt> if the rule grammar <tt>tree</tt> pattern is matched by the <tt>node</tt>.
The routine directly checks simple patterns made of leaf nodes and calls <tt>pattern</tt> for trees with branches that must be checked recursively.

<H3><a name="label"></a>6.3 Label</H3>

The <tt>label</tt> routine associates (<tt>setattr</tt>) with each tree node a <tt>state</tt> dictionary.
This dictionary maps non-terminals that can be derived from the grammar rules from this node to its total cost.
If non-terminal cannot be derived from this tree node, it does not appear in the dictionary.
The non-terminals, and the respective costs, are determined by the rules that can be matched from this tree node.
<p>
The <tt>label</tt> routine is applied recusively to each node.
It scans the tree depth first from the root <tt>node</tt> to its leafs setting the <tt>state</tt> attribute to each node.
The labeling process starts at the leaf nodes and makes it way back to the root node.
If a match between the current node and a grammar rules can be found, its non-terminal is added to the <tt>state</tt> and mapped to its cost, if the cost is higher than a previous cost for the same non-termninal.
If closures for this non-terminal exist, the other closure non-terminals must be added to the <tt>state</tt>.
<p>
The routine arguments arguments are the tree root's <tt>node</tt>, the grammar /<tt>gram</tt>), the list of terminal symbols in the grammar (<tt>terms</tt>), a function dictionary for variable cost functions (<tt>fdir</tt>) and a <tt>closures</tt> list (see <a href="#closure">closure</a>).
The routine returns no value, only the tree is labeled with <tt>state</tt> information.

<H2><a name="reduction"></a>7. Reduction functions</H2>

The reduction process selects the lowest cost at each node and executes the code associated with the rule that generated that cost.

<H3><a name="kids"></a>7.1 kids</H3>

Call the <tt>reduce</tt> routine for each node branch (or child/kid) for the pattern of the selected rule.
When a pattern has a left child (or kid) the node has a left branch, since it was matched by the labeling routine.
The same occurs for a right child.
Therefore, by scanning the tree pattern one can also navigate the AST tree node.

<H3><a name="reduce"></a>7.2 reduce</H3>

The reduction main routine <tt>reduce</tt> bootstraps the process for the goal non-terminal symbol (<tt>goalnt</tt>) and invoques the rule's associated user function.
The goal is redefined by each pattern that is applied when this routine is called by the previous <tt>kids</tt> routine.
